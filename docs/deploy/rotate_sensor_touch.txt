the command xrandr --rotate only rotates the display output, not the touch sensor input.

If you are using a USB touch sensor, you may be able to rotate its input by modifying the Xorg configuration file for the device.

You can try creating a new file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-rotate.conf with the following contents:

#########################################

Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "Touchscreen"
    MatchIsPointer "on"
    MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    Driver "libinput"
    Option "CalibrationMatrix" "0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1"
EndSection

#########################################

This assumes that your touch sensor is using the libinput driver, which is commonly used in modern Linux distributions. You may need to modify the MatchDevicePath line to match the correct device path for your touch sensor.

The CalibrationMatrix option specifies a 3x3 matrix that transforms the touch coordinates from the rotated display to the original orientation. In this example, the matrix performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

After creating the file, you can restart the X server or reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
